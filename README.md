ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @RafaelSandrini

In 2021 I've started my new career as a Software Developer, studing at Mohawk College.

My background is in civil engineering with several years of experience.

I have been spending most of my time studying Data Science, including Python language, Machine Learning methods and handling data.
